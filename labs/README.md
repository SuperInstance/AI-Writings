# labs — small, working, reusable tools

| lab | what it does | builds on |
|---|---|---|
| [`jev-fold`](jev-fold/) | splits a compound claim, has JEV score each part, returns the weakest part + divergence | — |
| [`weakest-claim`](weakest-claim/) | audits a guarantee: localize (fold) → quantum-drawn adversary (Moth + JEV choice) → report | **`jev-fold`** (imports `fold.mjs`) |
| [`quantum-fx`](quantum-fx/) | one zero-dep client for 5 Moth quantum engines (QRNG + Bell witness, coin toss, N-D quantum blur, QPIXL round trip, QEC "tamagotchi") | — |
| [`qd-arena`](qd-arena/) | MAP-Elites quality-diversity over 6 live generator models: JEV scores and places each idea on a 3×3 niche grid, the archive keeps the best per niche, and Moth picks the next niche | **`weakest-claim`** (imports `jev`, `mothDraw`) |
| [`situation-recorder`](situation-recorder/) | records a manager↔crew mission as a hash-chained transcript (`TASK/ROUTE/DRAFT/DRAW/FOLD/KEEP/DROP/MARK/OUTCOME`), draws un-gameable values locally from MicroMoth-quilt, backfills the corpus from the ledger, and builds model-ready tables + a base rate | chain byte-compatible with **MicroMoth-quilt** |
| [`tool-pin-receipts`](tool-pin-receipts/) | hash-pins tool/MCP manifests (fnv1a-64 per tool + manifest), flags drift (rug-pull) as RED `tool-drift` MARK records, and scans descriptions for injection (MCPTox-style poisoning); a captain pins the crew's tools and refuses RED/flagged ones | hash idiom from **`situation-recorder`** |
| [`rubric-forge`](rubric-forge/) | turns a hash-chained transcript into a **dense scalar reward** via a JEV weighted-rubric (harmonic mean of chain-leaf scores) — the dense signal B4 route-preference consumes to rank product-identical routes | **`situation-recorder`** chains; feeds **B4** |

`weakest-claim` builds on `jev-fold`: it takes a repo that already works and reuses it to make a
better one. Its first live audit was of `jev-fold` itself, and it found that the clause splitter
is the weakest guarantee.

`situation-recorder` is the capture cell: the fleet's real product is not only the repos a crew
ships but the recorded I/O of the manager↔crew system, saved decomposably so a model can learn to
decompose. One command — `bash situation-recorder/run_all.sh` — backfills from the ledger, folds in
the live transcripts, verifies every chain, and writes `situations/corpus/` + the base rate a
learned cell must beat. See [`../situations/arch/INTER-RELATIONAL-INTELLIGENCE.md`](../situations/arch/INTER-RELATIONAL-INTELLIGENCE.md)
and [`../situations/arch/CORPUS-REPORT.md`](../situations/arch/CORPUS-REPORT.md).
